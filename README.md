mathematics
----------

### ratio calculation
```
F(x, y) = y / x
```
### correction calculation
```
T(x) = floor(n / 2) * 2

F(n â‰¤ 9, s) = 0
F(n > 9, s) = s * (T(round(n) - 9) / 2) + s
```
### unit calculation
```
F(c, r) = c / r
```

issues
------
in my experience, firefox mobile cannot save data to local storage.
i would recommend using chrome or a chromium derivative for mobile use.

to do
-----

+ switch local storage to indexeddb
+ change storage type to be store meals per day
+ change importing and exporting to use files
